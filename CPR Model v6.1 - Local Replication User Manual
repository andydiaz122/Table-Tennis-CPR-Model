CPR Model v6.1 - Local Replication User Manual
This document provides the complete step-by-step instructions for running the CPR Model v6.1 system on your local machine. Follow this sequence precisely to ensure the model trains and predicts correctly.

Prerequisites
Python: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Data File: You must have your master data file named czech_liga_pro_advanced_stats_FIXED.csv in the same directory as these scripts.

Step 1: Install Dependencies
First, install all the necessary Python libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Feature Engineering
This is the first and most crucial step. This script will read your raw czech_liga_pro_advanced_stats_FIXED.csv file and generate all of our advanced, engineered features.

Run the script from your terminal:

python feature_engineering_v6.1.py

This will create a new file: full_feature_database_v6.1.csv. This file is the "fuel" for our machine learning models.

Step 3: Train the Specialist Models
Now, we train our two specialist models. These can be run in any order, but both must be completed before moving to the next step.

Train the "Situational Analyst" (GBM):

python cpr_v6.1_specialist_gbm_trainer.py

This will create the file: cpr_v6.1_gbm_specialist.json.

Train the "Momentum Analyst" (LSTM):

python cpr_v6.1_specialist_lstm_trainer.py

This will create the file: cpr_v6.1_lstm_specialist.h5.

Step 4: Train the Meta-Model "Manager"
Once both specialists are trained, we train the final "manager" model that learns how to best combine their predictions.

Run the script from your terminal:

python cpr_v6.1_meta_model_trainer.py

This will create the file: cpr_v6.1_meta_model.pkl.

Step 5: Make Daily Predictions
With all models trained, you are now ready to make predictions on new matchups. The cpr_v6.1_final_predictor.py script is designed for this.

You will need to manually edit the upcoming_matches list within this file with the day's matchups. Then, run the script:

python cpr_v6.1_final_predictor.py

The script will load all three trained models and print the final win probabilities.

Step 6: Calculate Wagers
Use the win probabilities from the predictor along with the market odds in the betting_strategy.py script to calculate your optimal wager sizes based on our Kelly Criterion strategy.
