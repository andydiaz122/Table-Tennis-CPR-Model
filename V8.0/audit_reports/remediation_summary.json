    "IMMEDIATE: Implement probability ceiling of 0.75 for Kelly staking",
    "IMMEDIATE: Use empirical win rates (not model prob) for bins > 0.70",
    "SHORT-TERM: Add H2H sample size regularization (dampen H2H effect when n < 5)",
    "SHORT-TERM: Investigate if MIN_GAMES_THRESHOLD needs increase from 4 to 10",
    "MEDIUM-TERM: Consider isotonic regression for post-hoc calibration",
    "VALIDATION: Re-run backtest with probability ceiling and compare ROI"

    "Add PROB_CEILING = 0.75 before Kelly calculation",
    "Modify Kelly formula: use min(model_prob, PROB_CEILING) for staking",

    "Consider excluding bets where Min_Match_Count < 20 AND Model_Prob > 0.80"
